# test-cartguru
A little game for cartguru ;)
## Install & Start:

To install all dependencies, run
```bash
npm install
```

Then to run the game with the default input file, just run
```js
npm start
```

You might want to try some other inputs!

- Either you can modify the `input` file in the project directory
- Or you can run the script with a location argument to pass it one of the test inputs in the `/src/lib/test/` directory

```bash
node index.js --location='/src/lib/test/correct.input.spec'
```
